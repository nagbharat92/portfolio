## What I built

This is a sandbox for trying new ideas — small, fast experiments built to learn something specific rather than ship something polished.

The site itself became the first experiment. Building a canvas-based portfolio in public, one PRD at a time, turned out to be more interesting than the projects it was meant to showcase.

## How it came together

Started with a question: what if the portfolio was the project?

Each piece — the design system, the canvas layout, the block-based content model — was designed first, then built. PRDs written before a single line of code. Constraints chosen deliberately.

The result is a site that can grow without getting messy. Adding a new project means adding a block array. Adding a new kind of content means adding a new block type.

Building things in the open has taught me more than any tutorial ever could.

Each experiment started with a single question — what happens if I just try it? Some went nowhere. A few turned into something worth keeping. All of them taught me something.

This is that collection. Unpolished by design. The point was never the output.
